A fast SNMP scanner, inspired by snmp-brute.nse.
Bulk-sends SNMP requests, listening for replies via libpcap.

For educational use only.

Usage: snmpbrute.pl -i <interface> -h <host> -l <community file> [-o oid[,oid[,oid]]]
          [-O <offset>] [-d delay] [-p port] [-s snaplen] [-p] [-t timeout]

    -o Comma-separated list of OIDs to try (fully numeric, no MIBs)
       Defaults to .1.3.6.1.2.1.1.1.0,.1.3.6.1.2.1.1.3.0

    -O Payload offset (e.g. size of ethernet+ip+udp header)
       Defaults to 42

    -d Delay in miliseconds between each GetRequest
       Defaults to 10

    -p Port, if different than 161

    -s Bytes to capture with libpcap
       Defaults to 1024

    -P If set, put device into promiscous mode

    -t Maximum time to wait for an SNMP reply in seconds
       Defaults to 5
       Note: That doesn't make the scanning slower, just uses more memory.
